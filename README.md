# NPC Comment Blocker

This is a simple plugin that blocks NPC comments in the youtube comment section. It is still in development and will be updated regularly.

Example of NPC comments:

```
- Whose here in [year]?
- Like if you are watching this in [year]
- Only legends will remember this
- You can like this if you aren't from tik tok
```

## Installation

1. Download/Clone the repository

2. Open the Extension Management page by navigating to chrome://extensions or about:debugging on firefox.

3. Enable Developer Mode by clicking the toggle switch next to Developer mode.

4. Click the Load unpacked button and select the extension directory.

## Usage

The extension will automatically block NPC comments in the youtube comment section.Since its in development there isn't a way to turn it off/on yet.

## Why is it not on the Chrome Web Store?

It costs 5$ to publish an extension on the Chrome Web Store and I don't want have the money to spend on that. If you want to publish it on the Chrome Web Store, please open an issue and I will be happy to help you.

## Roadmap

- Add a toggle button to turn the extension on/off - [X]
- Add a way to add custom comments to block - [/]
- Add an authentication system to block comments based on the user's preference [x]
- Add a way to customize the blocked comments - [/]
- Add an option to modify the comments instead of blocking them - [X]
- Improve the comments blocked and implement a better regex system
